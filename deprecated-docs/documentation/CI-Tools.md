### Continuous Integration (CI) Tools

We will look at getting a BrowserStack licence in the future, at the moment we have disabled this feature.This was will facilitate more stable CI testing [with PRs and builds].

##### Building with Bazel

As part of efforts to migrate to building with Bazel, ngx-layout is also migrating to CircleCI as part of the library's continuous integration toolset. This will work in tandem with Travis CI to handle all of our builds during the migration period.

More updates on our build process will be posted here as they're available.
